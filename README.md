# Demo Credit ðŸ’³

Demo Credit is a wallet management application that allows users to easily register, manage their wallets, and perform various financial transactions, including funding, withdrawing, and transferring money to other users.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Secure registration and login process.

- **Wallet Management**: Users can fund, withdraw, and transfer funds securely programmatically.

- **User-to-User Transfers**: Send money to other users within the system using wallet addresses.

### Authentication

This project uses JWT-based authentication with secure cookie storage. On successful login, the server sets the following HTTP-only cookies:

- `accessToken`: Used to authenticate protected routes. Automatically included in requests via cookies.
- `refreshToken`: Used to request new access tokens when the current one expires.

Tokens are not accessible via JavaScript (HTTP-only), enhancing protection against XSS attacks.


## Database Schema

### ER Diagram

The database structure is defined using two main tables: users and transactions.

- **Users Table**: Stores user information like email, username, password, and wallet details.

- **Transactions Table**: Tracks all transactions performed by users, including wallet transfers, deposits, and withdrawals.

Hereâ€™s a visual representation of the schema:
